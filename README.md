## Task Completion and Status

I've completed the main tasks and SIG AI Tasks too, overall I felt that all these tasks are fun as well as brainstorming. I enjoyed solving all these problems and they were so good. Although, I was sick and not doing good, I tried my level best to complete all the tasks. I have used this as an opportunity to learn another programming language.

## Overall Learning Progress

All through all the tasks I learnt effective way to programme, develop an application, work on GitHub and Linux. I also learnt problem solving and critical thinking while solving certain tasks. SIG AI tasks were so intresting, as I was able to play around with models analyze what will work and was helping me to express my learning progress there too. So concluding, all the tasks I've been completed are based on my experience and skill level which is required for the ACM's recruitment. I'm intrested in working with the club on research and open source projects. THANK YOU !!!
