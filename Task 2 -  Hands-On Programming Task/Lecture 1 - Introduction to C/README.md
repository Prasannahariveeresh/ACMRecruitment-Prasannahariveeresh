# Lecture 1 - Introduction to C

In this lecture I have started my learning journey from printing "Hello, World !" on screen to building a calculator that calulates expression with 2 numbers

I have attatched the files to record my learning progress

```

├── calculator.c
├── compare.c
├── hello.c
├── meow.c
└── README.md
```

## hello.c
Here I've learned how to print a text to the console along with getting an input from the user

![hello.c Output](https://github.com/?raw=true)

## compare.c
Here I've learned how to compare two variables using `if`, `else`, `elseif`. As we can't rely on cs50's library to get input from user, I've defined a function to get input from the user

![compare.c Output](https://github.com/?raw=true)

## agree.c
Here I've learned how to use or, and operators in if conditions. Here also I've defined a function to get input from the user

![agree.c Output](https://github.com/?raw=true)

## meow.c
Here I've learned how to use `while`, `for` loops to print meow specified number of times

![meow.c Output](https://github.com/?raw=true)

## calculator.c
Here based on my learning and knowledge so far. I tried to build a calculator solving two expressions with two numbers and an operators. I have used `switch` and `case` to perform operations.
